<p>With Keyboard Doodler, you can draw with your keyboard!</p>
<p>Why would I want this? You may ask. Drawing the trackpad is overrated! All the cool kids these days draw with the keyboard!</p>
<p>This plugin turns your keyboard into a canvas. By simply pressing keys, vector nodes in that key's location appear on the frame. Try it out and see what drawings you can create!</p>
<p><b>Tips: </b></p>
<p>1. Keyboard Doodler connects the vector points you draw. To end the current vector, press return (â†µ).</p>
<p>2. Your drawings are based on the keys' location in the generated keyboard frame. You can rearrange the keys on the generated keyboard to match your keyboard's layout.</p>
